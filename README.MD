# UrbanHeatInfo: An Urban Heat Island (UHI) Project
According to [National Geographic](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/urban-heat-island/), an urban heat island (UHI) is an area that experiences higher temperatures than its surrounding regions. This phenomenon is especially noticeable in large metropolitan cities and regions such as New York, London, or Hong Kong. Even at night, these areas remain hotter due to the concentration of people, energy use, infrastructure, and transportation systems.

Urban areas are typically densely populated and heavily built-up. Skyscrapers and other tall structures are designed to maximise space, but they also trap heat, limiting air circulation. Combined with concrete, asphalt, and other heat-retaining materials, these factors cause cities to warm faster and stay hotter for longer.

The impacts extend beyond temperature. Air quality declines as pollutants accumulate, while water systems also warm, disrupting their natural balance. Together, these conditions contribute to the negative effects of UHIs: 
* Rising global temperatures 
* Increased energy demand for cooling 
* Reduced air quality. 

These, in turn, pose serious health risks to urban populations, including respiratory illnesses and heat-related stress.

## Project Summary
Build a model that predicts **land surface temperature (LST)** / heat hotspots across a city using satellite imagery and local geospatial features (building density, tree canopy, land cover). The output will be delivered through an **interactive dashboard** showing current/predicted heat maps and **‚Äúwhat-if‚Äù** scenarios (e.g., +10% tree canopy).

## üåç Project's Impact
This project goes beyond mapping surface temperatures - it highlights how urban design choices affect health, equity, and sustainability:
* **Public Health**
    * Identifies heat hotspots to reduce risks from heat stress, respiratory issues, and heat-related mortality during extreme heat events.
* **Urban Planning Aid**
    * Provides evidence-based insights for interventions like tree planting, green roofs, or reflective surfaces to mitigate UHI effects.
* **Insights on How to Reduce Energy and Emissions**
    * Cooler urban areas reduce air conditioning demand, lowering peak electricity usage and associated greenhouse gas emissions.

## Future Update Ideas
* Multi-City Selection
    * I am currently focusing on a single city for now. However, I am planning to further expand the project so that users can select multiple cities in the future.
